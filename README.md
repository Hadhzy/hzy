## Installation
- It is really important to note, that `hzy` is only compatible with Linux. This is because it uses the [`snegg`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/snegg) API, which is only available on Linux.


- It is mandatory to have [`libei`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei) installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/snegg/-/blob/master/README.md#installation).

> **Note**: **libei needs to be installed**: It can be installed automatically, in the future!
> 
> 
```shell
python3 -m pip install hzy
```
